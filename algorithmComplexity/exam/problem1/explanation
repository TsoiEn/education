Problem1 is using pythagoras and summation formulas

"Enter N" defines the size of the array 
after entering the X and Y, natNum is the first function to be used

- natNum function having a parameter of the size of the array (N)
    - it will process the sum of natural numbers.
        - initializing the sum = 0
        - for loop 
            - initializing the first number which is 1 and adding it up to it reach the N 
    - this make the natNum function O(N)

- pythagoras function having the parameter of x and y
    - running time of O(n)
        - using the pythagoras formula 
        - for loop
            - calculating the difference of the current x to the previous x and same goes to y, then squares the difference and adding the x and y then storing it in sum until it reaches the last index of the array.
        - returning the square root of the sum which contains the euclidian distance.
        
output:
Enter N: 4
Enter values for x: 12 65 23 72
Enter values for y: 75 88 39 55
Sum of first 4 natural numbers: 10
Pythagorean distance: 134
